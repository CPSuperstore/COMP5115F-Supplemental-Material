This repository contains pretrained models used in my paper "GAN POINT CLOUD GENERATION WITH NEGATIVE SPACE"

Before running any of the provided code, please download this repository. Once downloaded, simply copy the `examples` directory to the root folder of the project, so that the file structure resembles the following. If this is not done, then many of the scripts will not run. The repository contains many pretrained models so experiments can be repeated without needing to wait for training.
